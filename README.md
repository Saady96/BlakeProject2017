Part of my contribution to my University Summer Internship

Creating an autonomous race car utilising TI microcontrollers.

The cars analogue accelerometer was connected to the ADC ports of the microcontroller.

Data was outputted onto the computer for analysis.

Photodiode speedtraps were used to measure the cars velocity at various point of the track.
